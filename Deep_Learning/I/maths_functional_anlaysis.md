*  Complete metric space is a metric space in which every Cauchy sequence is convergent. In other words, every Cauchy sequence in the metric space tends in the limit to a point which is again an element of that space.

### Compactness

* A metric space ( M , d ) is said to be compact if it is both complete and totally bounded.

* (M, d ) is compact if and only if every sequence in M has a subsequence that converges to a point in M.

* Let A be a subset of a metric space M. If A is compact, then A
  is closed in M. /f M is compact and A is closed, then A is compact.

* Let f : (M, d ) -+ (N, p) be continuous. If K is compact in M,
  then f(K ) is compact in N.

* Let ( M, d ) be compact. If f : M -+ R is continuous, then f is
  bounded Moreover, f attains its maximum and minimum values.

* In a metric space M, the following are equivalent:
  (a) Open sets union is super set

  (b) Closed sets intersection is not null

* ### Uniform Continuous 

* If f : M -> N is uniformly continuous, then f maps totally
  bounded sets into totally bounded sets.

* If M is a compact metric space, then every continuous map
  f : M -> N is uniformly continuous.

* Let D be dense in M, let N be complete, and let f : D -> N be
  uniformly continuous. Then, f extends uniquely to a uniformly continuous map. F : M -> N, defined on all of M. Moreover, if f is an isometry, then so is the extension F.

* Let ϕ:A1→A2 be a [bijection](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Bijection) such that:

  * ∀a,b∈A1: d1(a,b) = d2(ϕ(a),ϕ(b)).
