 * The nonvolitional cue is based on the saliency and conspicuity of objects in the 
   environment.
 * Using the volitional cue based on variable selection criteria, this form of 
   attention is more deliberate. It is also more powerful with the subjectâ€™s 
   voluntary effort.
 * To bias selection over sensory inputs, we can simply use a parameterized 
   fully-connected layer or even non-parameterized max or average pooling.
 * we refer to volitional cues as queries
 * Given any query, attention mechanisms bias selection over sensory inputs (e.g., intermediate feature representations) via attention pooling
 * These sensory inputs are called values in the context of attention mechanisms
